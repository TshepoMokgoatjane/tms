# Tenant Management System - TMS

This repository is for an application that I built using the teachings and knowledge from industry standard and famous software developers, craftmans and gurus in the field like Rod Johnson, Robert C. Martin, Martin Fowler, John Thompson and Chad Darby who have been offering interesting courses all over the Udemy platform for value for money.

## What is purpose of this project named TMS?
The purpose of this project is to allow the Landlord to efficiently manage their tenant's information thereby eradicating the use of papers and spreadsheets, which can become cumbersome in the long run. 

Therefore, we are going digital in our approach to make the Landlord's life and that of his tenants a whole lot easier.
